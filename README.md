## About The Project

SoloType aims to provide an engaging and effective platform for users to improve their typing speed and accuracy. Instead of generic text, users practice with content dynamically generated by AI, with difficulty scaling through familiar E-S Ranks.

### Key Features (Implemented & Planned)

* **Ranked Typing Tests:** Practice tests categorized by difficulty from E-Rank (easy) to S-Rank (challenging).
* **AI-Generated Content:** Test passages are dynamically generated using AI (Google Gemini) to match the selected rank and theme (Implemented for Ranked Tests).
* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password & Google). (Implemented)
* **Result Tracking:** Save WPM, accuracy, rank, and duration for logged-in users (Planned - Step 2).
* **Custom Test Mode:** Practice typing with your own pasted text (Planned - Step 4).
* **Adaptive Practice Mode:** AI analyzes your weaknesses from previous tests and generates targeted practice text (Planned - Step 5).
* **User Statistics:** View your progress, history, and personal bests (Planned - Step 6).
* **Solo Leveling Theme:** Dark UI aesthetic inspired by the source material.
